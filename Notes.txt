Note, at this point there was a problem with titled players. It's matching the player name, like fins, to get the page. But then in the game score it's listed as im fins. So for now I just check if the entered name is in the white player's name. This could be a problem if fins plays against someone named fins234 for example. Will have to work on that. 
  Probably like a check where if there is a space in the name, split it at "m " and take the [1] element. That will work, but first ask if a space is in it. Will need to add a fx that takes the name, saves it, and then does that processing. That actually shouldn't be too bad. 

But right now it works with the last 12 games. That's what loads on it's own on the rated page. 

To make this more robust and add more features learn selenium next.

The idea in line 2 is perfect. It's absolutely infuriating that it won't work. It won't find the space in the string accurately, even tho it works with any other string. But when I check 
" " in name it doesn't work. I print the name and it's right. I check for "m" and it works. It just won't check for the blank space. But split works so it sees the space. There is literally no reason why it won't work as originally written. The logic is perfectly sound. All tests work. It's only when I check for " " in the name it doesn't work. But any other number of tests and it works exactly as planned exactly as written. It only won't work for that one moment. Google was no help. 
So I found another way to make it work, but I hate it. I'm so mad that it won't work as it should. It makes no sense.
